### Hi there 👾

I'm Ran! Glad you found my profile 🥳

Here's a simple version of who I am:
- I’m currently working on bilingual technical docs for TiDB and related projects.
  - Check out 👉[TiDB Documentation](https://github.com/pingcap/docs). You are welcome to make your contribution!
- Apart from that, I’m also learning all sorts of stuff on *technical communication* and *content strategy*.
- I speak Chinese, English, and Japanese. But feel free to talk to me in any language.
- Also, if you happen to be learning Japanese too, **pleeeeezzzz** do contact me so we can study together 🌚
